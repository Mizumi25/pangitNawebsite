# This says President Sixto Durán Ballén signed decree No. 285, which
# established DST from 1992-11-28 to 1993-02-05; it does not give transition
# times.  The people called it "hora de Sixto" ("Sixto hour").  The change did
# not go over well; a popular song "Qué hora es" by Jaime Guevara had lyrics
# that included "Amanecía en mitad de la noche, los guaguas iban a clase sin
# sol" ("It was dawning in the middle of the night, the buses went to class
# without sun").  Although Ballén's campaign slogan was "Ni un paso atrás"
# (Not one step back), the clocks went back in 1993 and the experiment was not
# repeated.  For now, assume transitions were at 00:00 local time country-wide.

# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think tha
